# email-client

This is a tool I built while working as a software development intern at Familysearch. I created a Java Swing application that uses the Java Mail library & pings an Outlook API to grab unread emails from the user's inbox. Specifically, this tool looks for .csv files attached to unread messages, parses them, and combines them into one aggregate .csv file.
